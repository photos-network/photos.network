# Photos.network

Photos.network is a self-hosted, privacy first photo storage and sharing service.
Its core features are:

* Keep track of your photos with privacy
* Share photos and albums with friends, family or with public
* Search for photos by attributes like location, objects or people

Most applications for photo management are hosted in the cloud by big companies like Google, Apple or Amazon.
This application can also be hosted in the cloud, but **you are in control of all access rights**.


!!!warning
    This application is still in development and does not support all features!


    If you want to contribute the development: **[developers.photos.network](https://developers.photos.network/)**

    There is an early preview as [docker image](/installation/docker/)
